Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster is one of the popular ML challenges you will find over internet. This ML challenge is about predicting which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.This challenge asks you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).This ML project has helped me to learn different classification algorithms and have used few in this project. In addition, this project also gives proper insight on how the different features could be related with the passenger's survival. This project is really interesting and recommend to try if you are a beginner like me.¶
